```bash
pnpm install
```

### Testing

This project uses Vitest for unit testing and Playwright for end-to-end testing.

#### Unit Tests

The following unit test commands are available:

```bash
# Run tests once
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

#### End-to-End Tests

The project includes end-to-end tests that verify the extension's functionality in a Chrome browser. Tests run in headless mode by default for faster execution.

```bash
# Run e2e tests with clean context (recommended)
pnpm test:e2e:clean

# Run e2e tests in headed mode (visible browser) with clean context
pnpm test:e2e:headed:clean

# Run e2e tests with UI mode and clean context
pnpm test:e2e:ui:clean

# Run e2e tests in debug mode with clean context
pnpm test:e2e:debug:clean
```

See the [e2e-tests/README.md](e2e-tests/README.md) file for more details on the end-to-end tests.

### Building and Packaging

To build and package the extension for distribution:

```bash
# Clean, build, and create a distribution package
pnpm package
```

This will:

1. Clean previous build artifacts
2. Create a `dist` directory with all necessary extension files
3. Package everything into a zip file in the `build` directory

The packaged zip file will be named according to the version in package.json (e.g., `cc-generator-v2.0.0.zip`).
